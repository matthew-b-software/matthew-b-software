## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there

I'm Matthew, a recent summa cum laude graduated from Oregon State University <!--- (Go Beavs) --> who double majored in computer science and mathematical economics with a minor in math.
Through [MECOP](https://www.mecopinc.org/) I've had a 6-month internship with [Collins Aerospace](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/) and an 11-month internship with [ConMet](https://conmet.com/) working on the (now nonexistent) eMobility team.
Both internships were primarily focused on embedded development and DevOps.

Currently in the process of finding a job and working on a portfolio website to further my web dev skills and learn React.
